Archive:
- Calculates the full graphlet kernel
  as proposed by Shervashidze and Vishwanathan (2009)
  for graphlets of size 3,4,5

TOSOLVE:
- overflow error for some executions of the multiscale laplacian

TODO:
- correct the build frame work
- unit test by asserting the existing values
- add new kernels to graph_kernels.py
- support input format for dictionaries as list of tuples,
  list of truples, dictionary of tuples
- support sparse matrix format.
  (maybe change adjacency mat to scipy csr_mat?)
